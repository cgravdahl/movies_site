# movies_site
A site built with python and javascript 
This app is based off of a project I started with Udacity's Full Stack nanodegree. It started as a local files application and evolved into a web based app. The reasoning behind this is to get a better understanding of python and know-how of how to use python for web based applications. This is currently hosted on Heroku at https://cgravdahl-movie-site.herokuapp.com/

Currently the site uses omdb api to pull movie info but will be changed to rotten tomatoes api for better compatiblity with https.

To run this locally clone the files and run a build on entertainment_center.py.
